# Limnoria plugin for Soccer / Intl Football Live Scoring

## Introduction

This is a plugin for displaying kickoffs, goals and FT from soccer matches. I consider this limited appeal,
so it is not documented much. If you know what it does and that you need it, you either have talked with me
or can figure it out.

## Install

You will need a working Limnoria bot on Python 2.7 for this to work.

Go into your Limnoria plugin dir, usually ~/supybot/plugins and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/reticulatingspline/SoccerLive
```

To install additional requirements, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

Next, load the plugin:

```
/msg bot load SoccerLive
```

You will now need to register channels and leagues per channel.


## About

All of my plugins are free and open source. When I first started out, one of the main reasons I was
able to learn was due to other code out there. If you find a bug or would like an improvement, feel
free to give me a message on IRC or fork and submit a pull request. Many hours do go into each plugin,
so, if you're feeling generous, I do accept donations via Amazon or browse my [wish list](http://amzn.com/w/380JKXY7P5IKE).

I'm always looking for work, so if you are in need of a custom feature, plugin or something bigger, contact me via GitHub or IRC.
